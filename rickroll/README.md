Lab 5 readme

I correctly centered the rickroll video. I changed the title to have color and a pink background. I made the lyrics print at the appropritate times using a JavaScipt function and DOM object. 

I could not correctly use git to push the assignment to this repository.
  I manually made the rickroll folder on github in a moment of confusion and git pull was not working.
    Also tried to use git reset to "go back in time" however since I made the folder on github that did not work.
    I uploaded the lab manually on github. 
    
I spoke with Rebecca Glass about this assignment.

I spent roughly 3 hours (would've been 1 if i didn't manually make the folder) on this assignment.
