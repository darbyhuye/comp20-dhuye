Comp20 Assignment 2: The Ride Sharing Service 

Correctly implemented:
    I correctly implemented all parts of this assignment:
    a) If I am a driver, all passengers (that made requests in the last 5 min)
        appear on a map. If you click the passenger, a box appears with their
        username and distance from me. If you click me, my username appares with
        the distance to the closest passenger.
    b) If I am a passeneger, the above holds with diveres instead of passengers.

I discussed this assignment with Jarod Glover and Rebecca Glass.
